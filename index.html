        <h6>Posted on 27/7/19</h6>
        
        <p>Any of y'all whom believe that any type of pizza rather than Hawaiian is the best are all objectively wrong. Here's why.
        </p>
<ol>
    <li>There are no <b>disgusting</b> vegetables anywhere to be seen on the perfect pizza. It is topped only with toppings that actually taste good. Why would you ever put a mushroom or an onion on a pizza? You're just making it taste worse.</li>
    <li>Hawaiian pizza is very easy to make. You don't have to deal with chopping up vegetables or worrying if the chicken is undercooked or any of that garbage. Just chuck on shredded ham, pinapples and cheese and enjoy.</li>
    <li>Even among vegetable-less pizzas, Hawaiian pizza has a very good ingredient list. Anybody who thinks that pineapple on pizza is bad should take a good, long hard look at themselves in the mirror. Pineapple on pizza is one of the best inventions of human civilization.</li>
</ol>        
<p> Anybody who disagrees with me is free to leave their garbage, irrelevant opinions in the comments section. Just remember that society judges mouth-breathers like you harshly before commenting.</p>
